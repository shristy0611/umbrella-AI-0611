## 🔧 **How Does It Work?**
Imagine you own a small business and need to **analyze invoices**, **understand customer feedback**, or **get product recommendations**. Umbrella-AI does all of this **automatically** in these simple steps:

### 1️⃣ **User Request**
A business **uploads a file or asks a question**, like:
> "Here is an invoice. What should I buy next for my store?"

### 2️⃣ **AI Teamwork Begins**
The **Orchestrator (AI boss)** organizes the work and tells the right AI agents what to do.

- **PDF Extractor**: Reads the invoice and extracts useful data (e.g., total cost, items purchased).
- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Checks if customer reviews are **positive, negative, or neutral**.
- **Recommendation AI**: Suggests what products the business should buy next.
- **Chatbot**: Answers any follow-up questions.
- **Web Scraper (RAG AI)**: Finds extra useful data from the internet.

### 3️⃣ **Final Answer**
The system **double-checks everything** and **gives the business a well-structured answer**, like:
> "Invoice #12345 shows you purchased office supplies. We recommend buying **these top-selling items** to keep your inventory stocked."
