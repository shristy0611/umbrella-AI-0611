## 1. Project Initialization

### 1.1 Repository & Version Control  
- **Create a Git repository** that contains your complete project source code.  
- **Define branching strategies:**  
  - `main`: production‑ready code  
  - `dev`: active development  
- Include a robust **.gitignore** to exclude environment files, API keys, temporary artifacts, and Docker build artifacts.

### 1.2 Requirements & Environment Setup  
- **Document requirements** for each module (e.g., OCR/PDF extraction, recommendation engine, sentiment analysis, chat interface, web scraping with RAG).  
- Create a `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml`) with dependencies including:  
  - `google-genai`  
  - `langchain`, `pydantic`, `playwright`, etc.  
- **Configure environment variables:**  
  - API keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`)  
  - Database credentials, secret keys  
- Prepare an architectural diagram that shows each microservice (or agent), the orchestrator, vector database, and communication channels.

## 2. Local Development Setup (Mirrored on AWS Free Tier)

### 2.1 Directory Structure & Docker Configuration  
Organize your project with a clear directory structure (example):

```
umbrella_ai/
├── orchestrator/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── pdf_extraction_service/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── recommendation_service/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── sentiment_service/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── chatbot_service/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── rag_scraper_service/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── src/
│   └── tests/
├── vector_db/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── src/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
└── README.md
```

- **Docker & Docker Compose:**  
  - Each microservice runs in its own container.  
  - The `docker-compose.yml` defines all services, networks, and volumes, pulling environment variables from the `.env` file.  
  - For local development, mirror this environment on an AWS Free Tier instance running Docker (e.g., on an EC2 t2.micro) for testing.

### 2.2 Security and Local Testing  
- **Local Security Measures:**  
  - Store secrets (like your `GEMINI_API_KEY`) in `.env` (do not commit this file).  
  - Run containers as non-root users and expose only necessary ports.  
- **Testing Strategy:**  
  - Write **unit tests** for individual logic (e.g., image parsing, sentiment scoring).  
  - Develop **integration tests** to verify inter-service communication (the orchestrator calling PDF extraction and receiving structured responses).  
  - Set up **end-to-end tests** simulating a full user flow from input upload to final recommendation.

## 3. Core Multi-Agent Architecture

### 3.1 Orchestrator and Agent Roles  
- **Orchestrator Agent:**  
  - Manages overall workflow: accepts user requests (via API gateway or front-end), interprets tasks, maintains session state, and coordinates agent interactions.
  - Dynamically decomposes tasks and assigns them to specialized agents.

- **Specialized Agents:**  
  - **PDF Extraction Agent:** Uses Gemini’s File API (see Gemini API code below) for parsing and structured JSON output.  
  - **Sentiment Analysis Agent:** Uses a fine-tuned LLM to classify text sentiment.  
  - **Recommendation Agent:** Implements neural collaborative filtering or graph-based embedding to suggest products or actions based on historical data.  
  - **Chatbot Agent:** Maintains multi-turn conversation sessions and leverages Gemini for natural language responses.  
  - **RAG Scraper Agent:** Automates web navigation (e.g., using Playwright) to scrape and index data into your vector database.

- **Agent Integration:**  
  - Use asynchronous messaging (e.g., via message queues or direct REST/gRPC calls) to facilitate seamless inter-agent communication.
  - Optionally integrate frameworks such as **AutoGen**, **Semantic Kernel**, or **LangChain/LangGraph** to allow dynamic task decomposition and memory management. These frameworks will enable your agents to update their behavior in real time based on the dynamic task context.

### 3.2 Incorporating Gemini API Code  
Embed the provided Gemini API usage examples in your agent implementations (for instance, within the chatbot or image-processing agent):

#### Example: Gemini Text Chat Session

```python
!pip install google-genai

from google import genai
import asyncio

# Set up the client for Gemini API
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY", http_options={'api_version': 'v1alpha'})
model_id = "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
config = {"responseModalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model_id, config=config) as session:
        while True:
            message = input("User> ")
            if message.lower() == "exit":
                break
            await session.send(input=message, end_of_turn=True)
            async for response in session.receive():
                if response.text is None:
                    continue
                print(response.text, end="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Example: Gemini Single Image Model Usage

```python
import PIL.Image
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")
image = PIL.Image.open('/path/to/image.png')
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    contents=["What is this image?", image])
print(response.text)
```

*(Include similar snippets for multiple images and file API usage as needed.)*

## 4. Data Flow

- **User Request:**  
  - A user sends a request (e.g., “Analyze my invoice and recommend next products”).
- **Orchestrator:**  
  - Receives input and, using stateful context (via vector database or in-memory store), determines which agents to invoke.
- **Task Decomposition:**  
  - The orchestrator calls the appropriate agents sequentially or in parallel.
  - Example: PDF Extraction Agent parses the invoice; Sentiment Agent checks the tone; Recommendation Agent calculates suggestions.
- **Aggregation and Response:**  
  - The orchestrator aggregates outputs from agents into a coherent final JSON or text response, which is then returned to the user.

---

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### 5.1 Local (AWS Free Tier Mirrored Docker)  
- **Docker Compose:**  
  - Develop and test your system locally using Docker Compose on an AWS Free Tier instance.
- **AWS Free Tier Setup:**  
  - Utilize AWS Free Tier resources (e.g., EC2, Lightsail) to mirror your local Docker environment.
  - Ensure your environment mimics production configurations (including security groups, IAM roles, and minimal public exposure).

### 5.2 Production Deployment on AWS  
- **Container Orchestration:**  
  - Transition your Docker Compose setup to AWS ECS/EKS or AWS Fargate.
- **Networking & Security:**  
  - Configure a VPC with public subnets (for load balancers) and private subnets (for internal services).
  - Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage API keys and credentials.
  - Enforce IAM roles with minimal privileges.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Set auto-scaling policies based on CPU, memory, or API request throughput.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Use AWS CloudWatch or integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for logging and metrics.
  - Implement distributed tracing (e.g., using OpenTelemetry) to follow requests across agents.

---

## 6. Observability and Monitoring

- **Logging:**  
  - Implement structured logging (JSON format) in each microservice.
  - Store logs in CloudWatch or an ELK stack.
- **Metrics & Tracing:**  
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana or AWS CloudWatch metrics to monitor latency, error rates, and resource usage.
  - Integrate distributed tracing to capture inter-agent communication flows.
- **Alerting:**  
  - Set up automated alerts for abnormal behavior (high error rates, latency spikes) with defined on-call protocols.

---

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Write tests for core logic in each agent (e.g., for parsing, sentiment analysis, recommendation algorithms).
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Simulate service-to-service interactions: the orchestrator calling each agent and validating the aggregated output.
- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  - Create staging environments (mirroring production) to run scenario-based tests from user input to final aggregated output.
- **Load & Stress Testing:**  
  - Use tools like Locust or JMeter to simulate high request volumes and identify bottlenecks.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):**  
  - Set up pipelines that automatically run tests and deploy updates to your Docker containers.

---

## 8. Launch and Post-Launch Steps

### 8.1 Go-Live Checklist
- Verify all environment variables, API keys, and secret storage mechanisms.
- Ensure SSL/TLS certificates are properly configured for external endpoints.
- Validate domain/DNS settings for the public-facing orchestrator service.
- Confirm AWS usage quotas and free tier limits.

### 8.2 User Feedback and Iteration
- Monitor production logs and metrics to gather performance insights.
- Collect user feedback to refine conversational interfaces and agent responses.
- Plan for regular updates and continuous improvement cycles.

### 8.3 Maintenance and Roadmap
- Rotate keys and credentials periodically.
- Update CI/CD pipelines for new features and regression testing.
- Scale services incrementally as user load increases and new requirements are identified.
